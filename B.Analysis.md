# 1. Overall vs Market Trend

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/101379141/201812601-251896de-7e7e-4d18-80d1-0e4d03013949.png)

- Overall:
  - There have been about 29 millions booking times received on website X

  - In total, 4.46 billion dollar was revenue of website X with supporting of three advertisers A,B,C

- Market Trend:
  - Most of Customer belongs to "Short" Segment with over 66% of total that they prefer to book the hotel rooms about 0-14 days before traveling times. 
  - Trending of customer booking following by season. As you can see that, the majority of booking is raised in hot traveling season as Summer and Autumn.
    - June, July, August accounts for about 40% of total booking in a year and conversion rates of these months are always on top with over 0.41. 
    - By contrast, months in Spring and Winter receive 'cold' attention of customer, only about 5% of booking monthly and conversion rate is poor too. People prefer staying at home these months.

# 2. Advertiser Performance

- Overall, Advertiser A had the best performance with the dominance in customer segment "Short" and "Medium". About 15 millions bookings was done through advertising of company A , and those bookings equals to more than 0.3 billion dollar profit for company A.
  - Company C had their own strategy when they focus on 'Long' Customer Segment and dominant with about 60 million dollar of this segment only which has the biggest profit in this segment comparing to others company A and B. It also balanced between different segments as "Short" and "Medium".
  - In contrast, Advertiser B would be the saddest performance. Although, It ranked second place for total profit of 'Short' customer group, but in total their profit accounted for only 0.1 billion dollar. There was not clearly strategy in advertisement comparing to their components.
 
 - In detail, conversion rate of Advertiser A and C was always higher than B. It means that the Advertising of A,C was more effective comparing to B. A and C received more clicks and bookings more than B.
 - With "Profit Over Cost" Graph, we can see clearly strategy of A and C:
    - Company A, it balanced all segment customer 
    - Company C, it know which segment customer they need to focus by customer trending.
    - Company B, they probably think that it should give a favor for "medium" group , but I believe that it's not enough.

# 3. Which Country #

- After researching about the tourism information, I believe that the Country that we are doing analysis is Vietnam because of these reasons:
  - Revenue per booking of dataset is $156.2 (about 4 million vnd) comparing to about 6 million vnd of total traveling fee including hotel, eating, transporting, ... (internet information) could be approximate.
  - Excluding Tet Holiday and New Year Holiday (people refer comeback hometown instead of traveling), Other time of Vietnam's holiday is period of month (dataset) having high rate of conversion.

# 4. Final Comments #

- It can be seen that Website X had good cooperation with Advertiser A & C.
  - Understand the demanding of local market. 
  - Have clearly strategy for different customer segment
  - Contribute greatly to the total revenue of Website X (over 80% of total revenue)

- However, Advertiser B did a poor performance 
  - Does not catch up with the demanding of customer. 
  - Have unclear strategy.
  
- ðŸš© So, I believe that Website X should:
  - Focus more on quality Advertisers as A & C. 
  - Consider about cooperation with company B. If B want to continue be a partner, It has to have a better planning for next year. Change and update their source with better quality, update knowledge.
