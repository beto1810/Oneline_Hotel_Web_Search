# :triangular_flag_on_post: The Final Test Requirements
## 1.	Market Trending
One of the indicators that the Marketplace team cares about is the conversion rate of users. In other words, they care about the percentage of users who can find the right hotel booking for their needs on the ABC website. One way to determine this is to calculate the booking conversion rate, which is calculated by dividing the number of bookings by the number of clicks.

- These are some suggestions:
  - Draw a daily booking conversion chart for the whole year of 2019 for ABC website
  - Do you notice any trends? What factors are driving this trend? (What are the main drivers of this trend?)
  - Can you guess which country these data are from? On what basis do you speculate?

## 2.	Advertiser performance
- One of your main tasks as a Market Data Analyst is to understand advertisers' performance, using datasets similar to the one you were provided with. From an advertiser's perspective:
  - Assuming every advertiser has a profit margin of 15% for all customer segments (short, medium, long), calculate the total profit of each advertiser for the year.
  - Based on the trends you've discovered, what recommendations do you have for each advertiser to improve their advertising campaigns in 202
