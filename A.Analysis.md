- Gender and Attrition: The rate of attrition appears to be consistent between male and female employees, with no significant gender-based differences in the decision to leave the company.
Age and Attrition:

- Notably, younger employees show a higher tendency to leave the company. This could be attributed to their stage in life, as they may be less settled and more open to exploring different career opportunities. The average age of employees who have left the company is 37, while the average age of current employees is 40, suggesting that the younger workforce is more prone to attrition.
  
- Marital Status and Attrition: Employee marital status plays a role in attrition. Single employees, who may be less impacted by family obligations or personal crises compared to divorced employees, exhibit a higher propensity to seek new employment opportunities.
Approximately 25% of single employees have left the company in pursuit of more interesting work environments, whereas only about 10% of married and divorced employees have made the same choice.

- Distance from Home and Attrition: Employees facing longer commutes or larger gaps between their homes and the company are more likely to leave their current positions in search of job opportunities that are closer to their residences.

- After researching about the tourism information, I believe that the Country that we are doing analysis is Vietnam because of these reasons:
  - Revenue per booking of dataset is $156.2 (about 4 million vnd) comparing to about 6 million vnd of total traveling fee including hotel, eating, transporting, ... (internet information) could be approximate.
  - Excluding Tet Holiday and New Year Holiday (people refer comeback hometown instead of traveling), Other time of Vietnam's holiday is period of month (dataset) having high rate of conversion.

- It can be seen that Website X had good cooperation with Advertiser A & C.
  - Understand the demanding of local market. 
  - Have clearly strategy for different customer segment

# 6. Compensation & Benefit #

# 7. Conclusion & Recommendation #
  
- ðŸš© So, I believe that Website X should:
  - Focus more on quality Advertisers as A & C. 
  - Consider about cooperation with company B. If B want to continue be a partner, It has to have a better planning for next year. Change and update their source with better quality, update knowledge.
